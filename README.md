# Aritmethic-encrypting-hash
Basic aritmethic operations.
Generates key and saves it to the file, than encryptes text from text file with that key. After that loads key and decrypts our encrypted text file. Lastly it checks how hash function(sha1) works with very similar but slighlty different texts.
